The time complexity for the average case of FlightManager::load_flight_data() is O(F * logN), where F is the number of lines in all_flights.txt, and N is the average number of flights per airport.The time complexitgy for the average case of FlightManager::find_flights() is O(logN + C), where logN is the number of flights from a specific airport, and C is the number of valid flights (e.g. within the start and end time window).
