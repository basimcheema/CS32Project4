To test, change params.txt according to the following format:
all_flights.txt - flight data file
SNA - starting airport
YYZ - destination airport
1736284400 - Unix timestamp for start of journey
24 - max trip duration
1 - minimum layover time
4 - maximum layover time
Air Canada - preferred airline (OPTIONAL), can add more on new lines
